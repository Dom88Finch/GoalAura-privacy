## Privacy Policy – GoalAura

**Last updated:** 2 Feb 2026

GoalAura (“we”, “us”, or “our”) operates the GoalAura iOS application (the “App”).
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.

## Information We Collect

GoalAura does **not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data**.

Specifically, we do **not** collect:

* Names or email addresses
* Account or authentication information
* Location data
* Contacts, photos, or media
* Messages or communications
* Payment or financial information
* Advertising identifiers
* Analytics or usage tracking data

The App does not require account creation, sign-up, or login of any kind.

---

## How the App Works

GoalAura connects to a backend API hosted on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for the sole purpose of fetching football-related data required for the App’s functionality.

* All requests are **read-only**
* No personal data is sent to the server
* Requests are not linked to individual users or devices
* No identifiers or tracking information are transmitted

Any preferences or settings within the App are stored **locally on your device only**. Deleting the App will remove all locally stored data.

---

## Third-Party Services

The App uses AWS solely to deliver football-related data. No personal user data is transmitted or stored by AWS. No authentication, analytics, or advertising services are used.

---

## Data Storage and Security

GoalAura does not store personal data on external servers.
All locally stored data remains on your device and is protected by iOS security. Deleting the App removes all locally stored data.

---

## Data Retention

No personal data is collected, so nothing is retained externally.

---

## Your Privacy Rights

Because GoalAura does not collect or process personal data, requests for access, correction, or deletion of personal data are generally not applicable.
If you have questions about privacy or how the App works, you may contact us using the details below.

---

## Children’s Privacy

GoalAura does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Because the App does not collect personal data, parents do not need to take any action to protect a child’s information.

---

## Educational and Informational Disclaimer

GoalAura provides AI-generated football predictions and statistical tools for **educational and informational purposes only**.

* No betting or gambling services are offered
* No betting advice or recommendations are provided
* Predictions are estimates and may be inaccurate
* The App does not guarantee outcomes or accuracy
* Users are responsible for complying with applicable local laws

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
