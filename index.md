## Privacy Policy – GoalAura

**Last updated:** 10 Feb 2025

GoalAura ("we", "us", or "our") operates the GoalAura iOS application (the "App").
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how information 
is handled when you use the App.

---

## Information We Collect

GoalAura does **not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data**.

Specifically, we do **not** collect:

* Names or email addresses
* Account or authentication information
* Location data
* Contacts, photos, or media
* Messages or communications
* Payment or financial information directly
* Advertising identifiers
* Analytics or usage tracking data

The App does not require account creation, sign-up, or login of any kind.

---

## How the App Works

GoalAura connects to a backend API hosted on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for 
the sole purpose of fetching football-related data required for the App's 
functionality.

* All requests are **read-only**
* No personal data is sent to the server
* Requests are not linked to individual users or devices
* No identifiers or tracking information are transmitted

Any preferences or settings within the App are stored **locally on your 
device only**. Deleting the App will remove all locally stored data.

---

## Local Data Caching

To improve performance and provide offline access, the App temporarily 
caches football-related data on your device. This cached data:

* Contains only football match data and statistics
* Does not include any personal information
* Is automatically refreshed periodically
* Can be cleared manually through the App's settings
* Is removed entirely when the App is deleted

---

## Subscriptions and Payments

The App offers optional in-app subscriptions managed entirely through 
Apple's App Store. 

* All payments are processed by **Apple** through your Apple ID
* We do **not** collect, store, or have access to your payment information
* Subscription management (including cancellation) is handled through 
  your Apple ID account settings
* We use **RevenueCat** as a subscription management platform to verify 
  subscription status. RevenueCat processes an anonymous app-specific 
  identifier and does not receive any personal information

For more information about how Apple handles your payment data, please 
refer to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

For more information about how RevenueCat handles data, please refer to 
[RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** – To deliver football-related data. 
  No personal user data is transmitted or stored.
* **RevenueCat** – To manage subscription status. Only an anonymous 
  identifier is used. No personal data is shared.
* **Apple StoreKit** – To process in-app purchases. All payment 
  data is handled by Apple.

No authentication, analytics, or advertising services are used.

---

## Data Storage and Security

GoalAura does not store personal data on external servers. All locally 
stored data (preferences, cached match data) remains on your device 
and is protected by iOS security. Deleting the App removes all 
locally stored data.

---

## Data Retention

No personal data is collected, so nothing is retained externally.
Locally cached data is automatically refreshed and can be cleared 
at any time through the App's settings.

---

## Your Privacy Rights

Because GoalAura does not collect or process personal data, requests 
for access, correction, or deletion of personal data are generally 
not applicable.

If you have questions about privacy or how the App works, you may 
contact us using the details below.

## Children's Privacy

GoalAura does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including 
children under the age of 13. Because the App does not collect 
personal data, parents do not need to take any action to protect 
a child's information.

---

## Educational and Informational Disclaimer

GoalAura provides AI-generated football predictions and statistical 
tools for **educational and informational purposes only**.

* No betting or gambling services are offered
* No betting advice or recommendations are provided
* Predictions are estimates and may be inaccurate
* The App does not guarantee outcomes or accuracy
* Users should not rely on predictions for financial decisions
* Users are responsible for complying with applicable local laws

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes 
will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top 
of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes 
acceptance of the updated policy.
